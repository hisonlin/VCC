<h1>Introduction to Programming Assignment 1</h1>

<p>
    Complete the following tasks.
    <br>
    <em>60%</em> of the marks will go to successfully completing the tasks free of errors.
    <br>
    <em>20%</em> of the marks will go to how well you comment your code. This also incorporates good naming conventions
    for variables.
    <br>
    <em>20%</em> of the marks will go to how efficient your code is using the methods you have learned to this point.
</p>

<ol>

    <li><em>Complicated Tax Calculator</em>
        <br />
        In a previous class you wrote pseudocode and flow charts to calculate tax. This problem is very similar to that
        but may contain some changes and additions.<br>
        Write code that will ask the user, using a prompt, what their monthly gross income is. If the user doesn't type
        in a number tell them their mistake with an alert and do not proceed with the calculation.
        <ul>
            <li>If the user earns less than or equal to 500 dollars the tax taken is 0 and they are in the low tax
                bracket. Only for these people should you do the following. Ask the user how many children they have.
                For each child that they have, give them 10 dollars in child benefits. If the user does not type in a
                number they get 0 dollars in child benefits.</li>
            <li>If the user earns more than 500 dollars but less than or equal to 700 they are in the medium tax
                bracket. Tax taken here should be 15% of any sum that is over 500.</li>
            <li>If the user earns more than 700 dollars they are in the high tax bracket. Tax taken here should be 15%
                of the sum that is over 500 but less than or equal to 700 and 25% of everything over 700.</li>
        </ul>
        The final result should show in a single alert the user's gross income, the tax bracket (low, medium or high),
        total tax, child benefits and net income (gross + child benefits - tax).

        <p>Gross Salary = 400, Number of Kids = 2, Bracket = Low, Net Income = 420<br>
            Gross Salary = 620, Bracket = Medium, Net Income = 602<br>
            Gross Salary = 900, Bracket = High, Net Income = 820.15</p>
    </li>
